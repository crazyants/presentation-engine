# Presentation Engine 5.0

This repo marks the start of my quest to port my existing Presentation Engine code base to ASP.NET Core.

### 1. What is the timeline for this?

In the near future. Functionality required for the MVP has been completed. There is some testing and tweaking still to be done however.

### 2. Okay but seriously, when?

To be more specific: Soon. Very Soon.

### 3. What the hell is this project anyway?

Go here for more information and downloads of the current version. Both source and binary: http://jaylittle.com/article/view/presentation-engine

### 4. Your previous versions didn't have a license? What gives?

I've gotten old enough to give a shit. FOSS has done a lot of good for me over the years and its well past time I start returning the favor.

### 5. FOSS? This is .NET you silly man!

Yeah this port is being developed 100% on Linux.  The goal is for it to be able to work in a cross platform context, but I will be primarily developing it using tools available to me on Arch Linux.

### 6. What tools?

VS Code is what I'm using at the moment.  Though I've got a JetBrains production subscription, Rider (despite its extensive feature set) always seems to be a day late and a dollar short.  I've been able to work productively without it though, so that's a great testament to the state of the open source dot net community.  Beyond that I've continued to use Gimp for the graphical work and I have made extensive use of DataGrip for working with sqlite databases.
