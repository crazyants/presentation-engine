# Presentation Engine 5.0

This repo marks the start of my quest to port my existing Presentation Engine code base to ASP.NET Core.

### 1. What is the timeline for this?

In the future, possibly before my death. Too grim? How about a classic: When its done.

### 2. Okay but seriously, when?

To be more specific: Before George RR Martin finishes "A Song of Fire and Ice".

### 3. What the hell is this project anyway?

Go here for more information and downloads of the current version. Both source and binary: http://jaylittle.com/article/view/presentation-engine

### 4. Your previous versions didn't have a license? What gives?

I've gotten old enough to give a shit. FOSS has done a lot of good for me over the years and its well past time I start returning the favor.
