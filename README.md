# Presentation Engine 5.0

This repo is a journal of my quest to port the Presentation Engine code base to ASP.NET Core.  So far, good.

### 1. What is the timeline for this?

I am currently beta testing the MVP version on my two primary websites.  Once all the kinks are worked out, I'll make an official release.

### 2. Would you recommend using this right now?

Well I'm using it right now, but I've been known to do some stupid shit.  It's not fully tested but it is relatively secure and performs like a bat out of hell.

### 3. What the hell is this project anyway?

Go here for more information and downloads of the current version. Both source and binary: http://jaylittle.com/article/view/presentation-engine

### 4. Your previous versions didn't have a license? What gives?

I've gotten old enough to give a shit. FOSS has done a lot of good for me over the years and its well past time I start returning the favor.

### 5. FOSS? This is .NET you silly man!

Yeah this port is being developed 100% on Linux.  The goal is for it to be able to work in a cross platform context, but I will be primarily developing it using tools available to me on Arch Linux.

### 6. What tools?

VS Code is my primary development tool. Although I have a Rider license, I just haven't been able to get that into it.  A lot of this has to do with the fact that it lagged VS Code in support .NET Core 2.0 which I transitioned to pretty aggressively (e.g. days after it was released).  Bottom Line: For me the jury is still out on Rider, but I love VS Code.  Beyond that I've continued to use Gimp for the graphical work and I have made extensive use of DataGrip for working with sqlite databases.
