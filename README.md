# Presentation Engine 5.0

This repo marks the start of my quest to port my existing Presentation Engine code base to ASP.NET Core.

### 0. Progress has slowed, whats up?

.NET Standard 2.0, .NET Core 2.0 and ASP.NET Core 2.0 got released. While the codebase has been ported and works based on my testing, a lot of my tooling is broken (Omnisharp and parts of Rider). Until these issues get resolved, progress will be minimal.

### 1. What is the timeline for this?

In the near future. Progress has slowed due to upgrade issues, but most of the planned feature set has already been coded.

### 2. Okay but seriously, when?

To be more specific: Before George RR Martin finishes "A Song of Fire and Ice". Update: Way before.

### 3. What the hell is this project anyway?

Go here for more information and downloads of the current version. Both source and binary: http://jaylittle.com/article/view/presentation-engine

### 4. Your previous versions didn't have a license? What gives?

I've gotten old enough to give a shit. FOSS has done a lot of good for me over the years and its well past time I start returning the favor.

### 5. FOSS? This is .NET you silly man!

Yeah this port is being developed 100% on Linux.  The goal is for it to be able to work in a cross platform context, but I will be primarily developing it using tools available to me on Arch Linux.

### 6. What tools?

VS Code is what I'm using at the moment though it does leave a bit to be desired.  Even though Rider has hit RTM and I have a JetBrains All Products subscription, I find I'm still using VS Code as what it lacks in features it makes up for with speed.
